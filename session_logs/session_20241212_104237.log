Product and Company Overview
---------------
Starbucks Corporation is a leading roaster, retailer, and marketer of specialty coffee in the world, with over 10,000 stores across 34 countries. Starbucks offers a premium coffee experience, with a wide variety of coffee drinks, pastries, and food items. The company is known for its inviting atmosphere, knowledgeable baristas, and commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainability.

In a recent press release, Starbucks announced its commitment to become "resource positive," aiming to store more carbon than it emits, eliminate waste, and provide more clean freshwater than it uses by 2030 (Source: <https://www.starbucks.com/press/releases/starbucks-announces-ambitious-goals-to-become-resource-positive>).

Competitive Landscape
-------------------
Compared to Nestlé, Starbucks differentiates itself by providing a more premium and classy coffee experience. Nestlé offers a wide range of food and beverage products, but its coffee offerings, such as Nescafé, are generally positioned as more mass-market and affordable. While Nestlé has a larger global footprint and a more diversified product portfolio, Starbucks has a strong brand identity and a loyal customer base.
